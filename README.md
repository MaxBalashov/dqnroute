## Running

Option 1: run notebooks, such as [igor_run_simulation.ipynb](/notebooks/igor_dqn_pretrain.ipynb) and [igor_run_simulation.ipynb](/notebooks/igor_run_simulation.ipynb).

Option 2: run an all-in-one verification script [Verify.py](/src/Verify.py). In particular, it contains the "compare" command which only runs simulations. Some examples are given in [VerifyWrapper.py](/src/VerifyWrapper.py)

A more comprehensive description will be added soon!
